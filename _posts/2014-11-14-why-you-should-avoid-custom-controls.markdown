As a design lover I'm often tempted to redesign controls.
Make them *simpler*, *more intuitive*, *nicer*, *branded* or whatever seems to be a good reason.

Sometimes it might be good idea and **improve user experience** but sometimes it's not.
Especially when it comes to **basic controls** implemented by the device/browser.
