As a design lover I'm often tempted to redesign controls.
Make them *simpler*, *more intuitive*, *nicer*, *branded* or whatever seems to be a good reason.

Sometimes it might be a good idea and **improve user experience** but sometimes it's not.
Especially when it comes to **basic/native controls** implemented by the device/browser.

## Native controls

Native controls are on the *"software"* side, meaning they fully profit from device's hardware.
They are **stable**, **powerful** and users are used to them.

*Image coming...*

For example, browser's dropdown menu can overflow the window, block scroll on content, they are keyboard ready, ...
As real form elements they are designed to communicate data.
