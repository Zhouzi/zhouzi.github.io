Easy things makes you better...as long as you keep pushing your limits and stay curious.

The fact is that when things are complicated, we tend to focus on the **how** instead of the **why**.
We have to figure out how to reach the results from a *"technical"* perspective.
Doing so we lose sight and often stop asking ourselves, **why?**

Why are we doing it that way? Why should we even do that? What are the goals?
What are we trying to solve in the end?

There's a reason that explains why it's so hard to stay focused.
Whether it's about money, time or whatever, everything has a cost.
You can't keep asking **why** without taking act.
You might not have much time to think about the **why** neither.
You have to make choices and get the job done.
If things are complicated, you better start early and avoid thinking too much.

This is why you should make things easy.
Revert the balance, spend more time thinking and less executing.



___
The next time you're trying to accomplish something, don't ask **how**
you can do it but rather **why** you want to do it.
