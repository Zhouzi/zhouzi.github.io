This is how I see this site: as my new "home".

In fact I first thought that a personal website, for a front end developer, should be like a painting.
An illustration, a reflect of my skills and ability to make creative choices.
I had to overtake my limits to come to a "surprising" result.

A good opportunity to try new things sometimes a bit experimental.
And it was the case. I tried lots of things, patterns and I learned a lot.
I stopped when I judged the design was "singular" enough.

I wasn't completely pleased but I was ok with what I did.

But then, I was so concentrated on doing something special that I walked away
from what this site truly represents. I was selling an appearance while I wanted
to offer a reflection.

So I destroyed everything. I destroyed everything to make room for what is important to me.
And what is important to me is to be able to share. And anyway...
