title: "My pieces of advice to aspiring geniuses."

I often find my self looking at my past work.
It always reminds me how much side projects I've worked on.
To be honest, **most of them are just ideas and concepts**.
Some are in a more advanced state but wow, **I've been doing things so wrong!**
Sure we all start somewhere but looking backward, **there's things I would have done differently**.
Here is my take dedicated to _"aspiring geniuses"_[1](#im-not-a-genius).

## Working hard

I was in the middle of my second year at ILOI[2](#iloi) when I really started to work hard.
I understood that I won't get anything without **99% perspiration**[3](#thomas-edison-quote).
From that moment I started to build complex and large projects.
I was spending 100% of my time doing and _learning from my **practical** mistakes_.

I learned a lot by failing and I'm part of those who thinks it's a great way to get better.
However, learning through failure doesn't mean you should **close your eyes and your mind**.
I believe that working hard is not enough - or at least **its definition is often unclear**.

Just as I did, you might be tempted to jump in and spend 100% of your time building things.
Your very own projects, ideas, and products.
Being enthusiastic is great but hey, slow down a minute.
**Working hard is not about confining yourself in your own bubble**.

You have cool ideas, I won't doubt that but are you **aware**?

## Geniuses secret sauce

You probably know someone you're envious of.
You know, the one that seems to be good at whatever he's doing.
This particular guy that seems to have a natural gift.
We've all met some of them and so did I.
Those guys are what we'd define as **geniuses**, always **one lap ahead**.

Actually, I believe that their shared trait is that they are _"aware"_.

What makes them so good is that they are in phase with their field.
They learned from the past and are looking into the future.
They are not just productive, they are **up to date**.
While working hard they spend **80% of their time doing, 20% learning**.

This is why I'd advice _front-end_ beginners to make sure that your "working hard" process contains:

* Reading articles, books about your field of expertise
* Making sure you are using the right tools/framework
* Being aware of the trends
* Experimenting stuff

This is what I would have done differently.

### What about you?

Looking backward, what do you retain from your own experience?
What advices would you give to a previous version of yourself?[4](#steal-like-an-artist)
I'm really interested to learn from your experience so let me know in the comments!
