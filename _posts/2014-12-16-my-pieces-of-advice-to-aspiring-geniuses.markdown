I often find my self looking at my past work.
It always reminds me how much side projects I worked on.
To be honest, **most of them are just ideas and concepts**.
Some are in a more advanced state but wow, **I've been doing things so wrong!**

I feel somewhat nostalgic but mostly happy.
Being able to recognize that I have been doing things wrong probably means I'm doing better now.
Looking backward, **there's several things I would have done differently** so here is my take dedicated to _front-end_ beginners.

# Spend 80% of your time doing, 20% learning

I was in the middle of my second year at ILOI[1] when I really started working hard.
I understood that I won't get anything without **99% perspiration**[2].
From that moment I started to build complex and large projects.
I was spending 100% of my time doing and _learning from my **practical** mistakes_.

The problem is that I was actually rebuilding things, I was **reinventing the wheel**.
I was a prisoner of my own bubble ignoring what was really happening in my field.
(...)
This is why I'd advice front-end beginners to spend 20% of your time:

* Reading articles, books about your field of expertise
* Making sure you are using the right tools/framework
* Being aware of the trends
* Experimenting stuff

# The secret sauce of _geniuses_

You probably know someone you're jealous and/or envious of.
You know, that guy that's seems to be good at whatever he's doing.
The one that's so great that you wonder why he's still in your classroom.
Yep, this particular guy that's seems to have a natural gift.

I've met lots of them and when I make the comparison, what I get out of it it that they are all **aware**.
They spend/spent lots of time learning and **they are always one lap ahead**.
So...
