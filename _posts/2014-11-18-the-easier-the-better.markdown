When things are complicated, we tend to focus on the **hows**.
We have to figure out **how** to reach the expected results from a *"technical"* perspective.
Doing so we lose sight and often stop asking ourselves the right question: **why?**

Whether it's about money, time or whatever, everything has a *price*.
We have to take action as fast and cheap as possible.
In this situation there is not much time left to thinking.

But guess what? Easy tasks doesn't cost much.
Easiness free your mind so you're willing to think about the **whys**.
Why are you doing what you do in that way? Why not doing it otherwise?
What are the goals? What are you trying to solve from the very first place?

You should make room to think about the **big picture**, the real questions.

## Making things easy ain't that easy.

There is probably several things you can do right now to improve your workflow.
Starting by **using the right tools**, **avoiding repetition**, **getting rid of bad habits**, ...
But to be honest, I think that making things easy is mostly about **working hard**.
It's about mastering your skills, killing the barriers to unleash your mind. Oh and...

> Don't reinvent the wheel, use whatever makes sense to speed up your process.

If you're asked to build a todo app in a couple of hours, are you going to code the whole thing yourself?
Are you going to stick with jQuery and build your own framework? Sure you could.
But by opting for a solution like ember, backbone, knockout or angular you're definitely going to leave more room to think about what is going to make your todo app awesome.
