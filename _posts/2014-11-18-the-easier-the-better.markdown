Do your best to make things easy and you'll get better at what you do.
At least, as long as you keep pushing your limits and stay curious.

The fact is that when things are complicated, we tend to focus on the **how** instead of the **why**.
We have to figure out how to reach the results from a *"technical"* perspective.
Doing so we lose sight and often stop asking ourselves, **why?**

Why are we doing it that way? Why should we even do that? What are the goals?
What are we trying to solve in the end?

It's hard to stay focused since everything as a cost, whether it's about money, time or whatever.
We have to take action so we can't keep asking **why** for too long.
When facing complex situations we better start early to get the job done.

Unless things are easy enough to leave some room to think about it.
The point is, easy things doesn't *cost* much so you're able to **think** more.

## Making things easy ain't that easy.

Actually there is probably several things you can do right now.
Think about what you do on a day-to-day basis.
Can't you improve your workflow by avoiding repetition?
Maybe you are not using the right tools? The right framework?

Those are little things that are certainly going to help you by leaving time to think about the **why**.
But to be honest, I think that making things easy is mostly about working hard.
It's about mastering your skills so you won't have to think too much about the **how**.
Kill the barriers, unleash your mind to think about the big picture.

## A continuous and endless process.

It's a continuous process in that we should always do our best to make things easier.
Never stop, think about the big picture, think about the why.
And when you feel like things are easy enough, make them even easier.
Learn new things, improve your skills, experiment, try.
