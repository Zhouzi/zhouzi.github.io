        <p class="introduction">
          I am a passionate front-end developer spending most of my spare time experimenting and learning.
          I am constantly building stuff and contributing to open source projects.
          My side projects often lead to me through areas I enjoy exploring: performance, animations, JavaScript libraries and test frameworks (among other things).
          I like to call my mindset "open source first".
          Which means that I try hard to contribute to existing projects and/or open source my work when looking for a solution.
        </p>
        <p class="introduction">
          Despite my background in computer arts, I've always been better at coding than designing.
          Learning about user experience, user interface and graphic design actually taught me some great lessons that made me a better developer.
          First and foremost, I learned to always question the problem at hand to identify the simplest possible and adequate solutions.
          It also gave me a good sense of the details, which I believe to be part of why I am so eager to learn to write nicer and cleaner code everyday.

            Wizbii is a professional social network targeting recent graduates.
            I joined the company when it started to recruit in-house developers to build the next version of the product.
            From that point I became responsible for everything front-end: workflow, responsive, performance, architecture and so on.
            The core technologies are: Angular, SASS, Gulp.
            But some of Wizbii's products are also built on top of things like Webpack, React, CSS style guides, and so on.

            Nexboo is a social bookmarking platform.
            I've been building the bookmarklet during this internship.
            The tool offered users a way to draw a rectangle on any page to save the content in the selection.
            It was built without jQuery in an era where the DOM api wasn't as rich as it is today.
            It was pretty tough but I learned a lot about the DOM and had to tackle some performance issues.
