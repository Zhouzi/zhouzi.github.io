It was a time when I wasn't sure whether I was a **designer** or a **developer**.
Back then it seemed hard to conciliate both, I had to choose between **thinking** or **executing***.

But you know what? I didn't, I just continued to do what I love: **building experiences**.
And there is a name for that kind of job nowadays: **front-end developer**.

To me, a front-end developer's role is not just to **make things happen** but to ensure that
**user experience is delightful**, no matter on what device. To do so I do my best to **keep technical
considerations out of the way** to build **user-first** products [@wizbii](http://wizbii.com).

_*No offense, just making things kind of dramatic._
