I am **Gabin Aureche**, a **Front-End Developer** focused on **User Experience** [@wizbii](http://wizbii.com).

Well, I'm rather **obsessed by end user's happiness**.
I believe that nothing should be done without thinking about him.
To me, **he is the one who rules**. He can't be wrong, as long as he doesn't do it on purpose.
Actually I'm passionate about human behavior and psychology.
I like to discover and **build delightful experiences** full of those little details that matters.

You can find me experimenting on [codepen](http://codepen.io/Zhouzi/) and building stuff on [github](https://github.com/Zhouzi).
