I am Gabin Aureche, a french front-end developer working at [Wizbii](http://wizbii.com/).
I am a problem solver that is passionate about human behavior and obsessed by user experience.

I build user-centered, responsive client side solutions.
My current tools of the trade are [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/).
I am also a big fan of [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), the [BEM](https://en.bem.info/method/definitions/#Unified-Data-Domain) methodology and [Reactive Systems](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/).

I dedicate most of my spare time to funny [open source projects](https://github.com/Zhouzi) and [experiments on CodePen](http://codepen.io/Zhouzi/).
