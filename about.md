I am a french geeky front-end developer focused on user experience.
Which means that I am passionate about all things tech and design 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

On a day to day basis I code responsive user interfaces using HTML, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/).
I spend most of my spare time exploring new technologies through funny projects and experiments on [GitHub](https://github.com/Zhouzi) and [Codepen](http://codepen.io/Zhouzi/).
The fact that the majority of them actually involves an user dimension tells a lot about my obsession for user experience.
