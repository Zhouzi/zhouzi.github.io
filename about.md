I am **Gabin Aureche**, a **Front-End Developer** focused on **User Experience** working [@wizbii](http://wizbii.com).

I prefer to talk about **experiences** rather than **features**.
I also think that **users' expectations** should always be at the **top of a project's considerations**.
This is why I always do my best to keep **technical aspects out of the way**.
Choosing the **right tools**, **technologies** and taking the right **decisions** is a **developer's shit** and should stay as is.

I believe that the famous quote from **Joe Sparano** could also be applied to development*.

> Good design is obvious. Great design is transparent.
