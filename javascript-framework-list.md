Front-end frameworks and libraries are so numerous that it's hard to keep track of them all.
The purpose of this page is to list them so you won't miss any.
Let me know if you have suggestions, I'd be glad to extend this list!

**Note**: qualifying JavaScript technologies tends to get more and more complex nowadays.
Some of the following tools might fall in the **library**, **framework** or **plugin** category.
They are described as **MVC/MV\*/MVVM**, **Reactive** frameworks or simply as good starting points.
What they have in common is that they helps building **rich and complex web application** in today's world.



# AngularJS

Well, introducing [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is a bit awkward as it's probably the most famous framework nowadays.
One could argue that it's the most powerful as well but I won't.
Actually Angular is large, complex, based on **two-way data binding** and can likely achieve whatever you can dream of.
It also means that it might not suit simple and basic applications so make sure your choice is appropriate.

# Knockout

If you want to write pure JS with a simple, lightweight and pretty well supported framework, your best bet could be [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/).
It has no dependencies while implementing the core features of a great framework.

# Backbone.js

[Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) is one of the oldest and most famous tool of this list.
If you discovered it lately you could be disappointed as it has no _"native"_ implementation of two-way data binding.
However Backbone is pretty simple, provides great structure while leaving the power in your hands.
This is probably why lots of frameworks are based on it.

# Virtual DOM

Manipulating the DOM has a lots of impact on performance.
This is a real consideration as most of nowadays front-end technologies are based on client-side template rendering.
A solution is to create a virtual DOM and to update only what's needed, when it's needed.
This is exactly what [Virtual DOM](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) is all about.
