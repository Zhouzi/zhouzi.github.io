Front-end frameworks and libraries are so numerous that it's hard to keep track of them all.
The purpose of this page is to list them so you won't miss any.
Let me know if you have suggestions, I'd be glad to extend this list!

**Note**: qualifying JavaScript technologies tends to get more and more complex nowadays.
Some of the following tools might fall in the **library**, **framework** or **plugin** category.
They are described as **MVC/MV\*/MVVM**, **Reactive** frameworks or simply as good starting points.
What they have in common is that they helps building **rich and complex web application** in today's world.



# AngularJS

Well, introducing [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is a bit awkward as it's probably the most famous framework nowadays.
Angular is powerful and has a pretty well pronounced "wow" effect.
The fact is you'll end up doing cool things early in your learning.
However, with time going on, you'll figure out that Angular has its cons too.
One major being its performance issue so make sure you know what you are up to if you plan to use it for a large project.

# Knockout

[Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) is **simple**, lightweight an well supported.
Meaning it might lack of certain features if you are searching for a "complete" framework.
It is a good choice if you are working on a small to medium project.
Otherwise, you will have to mix it with other tools (which is not really a problem).
Oh and did I mention that writing knockout code is almost like writing pure javascript?

# Backbone.js

[Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) is one of the oldest and most famous tool of this list.
It is well documented, simple, structuring and offers a great support for REST services.
There is no "magic" with backbone.
You know what you do and how it will impact the application by keeping full control over everything.

# Virtual DOM

Manipulating the DOM has a lots of impact on performance.
This is a real consideration as most of nowadays front-end technologies are based on client-side template rendering.
A solution is to create a virtual DOM and to update only what's needed, when it's needed.
This is exactly what [Virtual DOM](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) is all about.
